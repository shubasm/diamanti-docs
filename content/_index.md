## Diamanti Enterprise Kubernetes Platform
Diamanti’s enterprise Kubernetes platform gives platform architects, IT operations, and application owners the performance and enterprise features needed to run cloud-native applications at scale.
With open-source Docker and Kubernetes fully integrated into the platform, together with purpose-built hardware and multi-cloud integration, Diamanti is full-featured Kubernetes infrastructure that deploys in minutes.

### Purpose-Built for Kubernetes
Diamanti is the only provider to combine an integrated software solution that includes Docker, Kubernetes and intelligent I/O controls with a patented I/O-optimized architecture and high performance, NVMe-based hyperconverged infrastructure. Diamanti’s virtualized approach to network and storage traffic management addresses the unique requirements of cloud-native applications. At the same time, Diamanti delivers unmatched resource utilization—up to 95%—across the entire cluster. No other Kubernetes infrastructure achieves comparable performance in such a small data center footprint.

### Plug-and-play Networking
Containers have their own unique system of port mappings, overlays, and bandwidth requirements that create a host of interoperability challenges. Diamanti eliminates these configuration roadblocks by integrating directly with existing network infrastructure. Each container is automatically allocated an IP address and can reside on any subnet.

### Fast NVMe-based Persistent Storage
Legacy scale-up storage arrays don’t fit modern scale-out containers. Trying to achieve performance at scale for databases and key value stores has ops teams scrambling to deliver persistent storage. Diamanti meets the storage needs of your stateful applications with low-latency NVMe block storage, delivering 100-microsecond read/write latency. Diamanti extends NVMe across the cluster using standard 10Gb Ethernet, offering data mobility without compromise.

### Seamless Scalability
Easily scale your Kubernetes infrastructure with multi-cloud capabilities and Diamanti appliances that deliver 1,000,000+ IOPS per 1U node and sub-millisecond latency.

### 24×7 Enterprise-class Support
By providing single-point-of-contact support for your container stack, Diamanti allows you to focus on developing applications instead of building and maintaining infrastructure.
